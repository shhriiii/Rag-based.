# Rag-based.
RAG App: Contextual Question Answering

Introduction

Greetings! We are Team McFlurry, and this is our project: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. The app combines database-backed context retrieval and an LLM to provide accurate, context-aware answers to user questions. This README will guide you through the structure, functionality, and usage of our app.

Features

Dynamic Chat Input: Users can input questions through an intuitive chat interface.

Custom Database Integration: Built using LangFlow and Astra DB.

Efficient Context Retrieval: Data vectorized using Gemini embeddings for fast and accurate context retrieval.

LLM Integration: Powered by Gemini LLM, providing free and insightful responses.

Workflow Overview

1. Chat Component

Users input their questions through the chat component. This serves as the entry point for the application.

2. Prompt Component

The prompt contains two key variables:

context: Retrieved from the database based on user input.

question: Directly received from the chat input.

3. Database Creation

Dataset Specification: Users provide a dataset path via a generic file component.

Database Ingestion: The dataset is ingested by Astra DB, which acts as the vector store.

Astra DB Features: A scalable, cloud-native database provided by DataStax.

4. Data Vectorization

Data is vectorized using Gemini embeddings, allowing efficient similarity searches within the vector database.

5. Context Retrieval

Search Results: Queries retrieve vectorized data, which is passed through a parser to convert it into plain text. This serves as the context for the LLM.

6. LLM Integration

The Gemini LLM processes the context and question to generate accurate, context-aware answers.

Why Gemini?: Free to use and integrates seamlessly with our pipeline.

7. Output Component

The final response is displayed in the chat output component, completing the workflow.

How to Use

Set Up Astra DB:

Create an Astra DB instance at DataStax Astra.

Secure your API endpoint and application token.

Load Dataset:

Specify the path to your dataset using the file component.

Ensure the dataset is in a supported format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

Run the Application:

Input a question in the chat interface.

The app retrieves relevant data, processes the prompt, and displays the answer.

Leverage Additional Insights:

Ask follow-up questions to extract more detailed or related information.

Key Technologies Used

LangFlow: For building the pipeline and managing components.

Astra DB: A vector database for storing and retrieving context.

Gemini Embeddings: To vectorize data for similarity search.

Gemini LLM: For generating responses from the retrieved context.Why Gemini?: Free to use and integrates seamlessly with our pipeline. We have specifically chosen Gemini because it is free of cost, making it an accessible and budget-friendly option.

Example Use Case

Input Question: "How do I optimize social media engagement?"

Generated Response: The app retrieves context from the database, processes the query, and provides actionable insights.

Conclusion

Our RAG app demonstrates the potential of combining databases with LLMs to deliver accurate, context-driven answers. We hope you find this application useful and inspiring. Thank you for exploring our project!
